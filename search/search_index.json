Each page added is represented as a new tab in frontend. VisualizableLevel        Each level corresponds to a line in the final frontend visualizations. Every level is made of a        VisualizableHorizontalList.       The dimension of the level can be customized with the size parameter (1 is the biggest, 6 is the smallest).       VisualizableHorizontalList An horizontal list of visualizable elements. In the example there is an horizontal list of vertical lists. VisualizableVerticalList A vertical list made of a name, a title, and the list of elements. VisualizableTable A table of visualizable elements. In the example there is a table of base and vertical lists. VisualizableBool The representation of a boolean value. It can be enabled or disabled with colors. VisualizableTitle The representation of a tuple, composed of a title and a value. VisualizableBase The representation of a base string. Can have a link attached to it and even an icon. The background color can be changed. The title above is composed by two `VisualizableBase` <p>Inside a <code>Visualizer</code> you can retrieve the reports of the analyzers and connectors  that have been specified inside configuration of the Visualizer itself using <code>.analyzer_reports()</code> and <code>.connector_reports()</code>. At this point, you can compose these values as you wish wrapping them with the <code>Visualizable</code> classes mentioned before.</p> <p>The best way to create a visualizer is to define several methods, one for each <code>Visualizable</code> you want to show in the UI, in your new visualizer and decore them with <code>visualizable_error_handler_with_params</code>. This decorator handles exceptions: in case there is a bug during the generation of a Visualizable element, it will be show an error instead of this component and all the other Visualizable are safe and will render correctly. Be careful using it because is a function returning a decorator! This means you need to use a syntax like this:</p> <pre><code>@visualizable_error_handler_with_params(error_name=\"custom visualizable\", error_size=VisualizableSize.S_2)\ndef custom_visualizable(self):\n   ...\n</code></pre> <p>instead of the syntax of other decorators that doesn't need the function call.</p> <p>You may want to look at a few existing examples to start to build a new one:</p> <ul> <li>dns.py</li> <li>yara.py</li> </ul>"},{"location":"IntelOwl/contribute/#how-to-share-your-plugin-with-the-community","title":"How to share your plugin with the community","text":"<p>To allow other people to use your configuration, that is now stored in your local database, you have to export it and create a data migration</p> <ol> <li>You can use the django management command <code>dumpplugin</code> to automatically create the migration file for your new analyzer (you will find it under <code>api_app/YOUR_PLUGIN_manager/migrations</code>).

Therefore,  <ul> <li>It is possible to attach every optional docker container that IntelOwl has: multi_queue with traefik enabled while every optional docker analyzer is active.</li> <li>It is possible to insert an optional docker argument that the CLI will pass to <code>docker-compose</code></li> </ul> <p>Now that you have completed different configurations, starting the containers is as simple as invoking:</p> <pre><code>$ ./start prod up\n</code></pre> <p>You can add the <code>docker</code> options <code>-d</code> to run the application in the background.</p> <p>Important Info</p> All <code>docker</code> and <code>docker compose</code> specific options must be passed at the end of the script, after a <code>--</code> token.

Before upgrading, some important things should be checked by the administrator:</p> <ul> <li>Docker Compose V1 support has been dropped project-wide. If you are still using a Compose version prior to v2.3.4, please upgrade to a newer version or install Docker Compose V2.</li> <li>IntelOwl is now started with the new Bash <code>start</code> script that has the same options as the old Python <code>start.py</code> script but is more manageable and has decreased the overall project dependencies. The <code>start.py</code> script has now been removed. Please use the new <code>start</code> script instead.</li> <li>The default message broker is now Redis. We have replaced Rabbit-MQ for Redis to allow support for Websockets in the application:</li> <li>This change is transparent if you use our <code>start</code> script to run IntelOwl. That would spawn a Redis instance instead of a Rabbit-MQ one locally.</li> <li>If you were using an external broker like AWS SQS or a managed Rabbit-MQ, they are still supported but we suggest to move to a Redis supported service to simplify the architecture (because Redis is now mandatory for Websockets)</li> <li>Support for multiple jobs with multiple playbooks has been removed. Every Observable or File in the request will be processed by a single playbook.</li> <li>We upgraded the base PostgreSQL image from version 12 to version 16. You have 2 choice:</li> <li>remove your actual database and start from scratch with a new one</li> <li>maintain your database and do not update Postgres. This could break the application at anytime because we do not support it anymore.</li> <li>if you want to keep your old DB, follow the migration procedure you can find below</li> </ul> <p>Warning</p> CARE! We are providing this database migration procedure to help the users to migrate to a new PostgreSQL version.  Upgrading PostgreSQL is outside the scope of the IntelOwl project so we do not guarantee that everything will work as intended.  In case of doubt, please check the official PostgreSQL documentation.  Upgrade at your own risk.   <p>The database migration procedure is as follows:</p> <ul> <li>You have IntelOwl version 5.x.x up and running</li> <li>Bring down the application (you can use the start script or manually concatenate your docker compose configuration )</li> <li>Go inside the docker folder <code>cd docker</code></li> <li>Bring only the postgres 12 container up <code>docker run -d --name intelowl_postgres_12 -v intel_owl_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ --env-file env_file_postgres  library/postgres:12-alpine</code></li> <li>Dump the entire database. You need the user and the database that you configured during startup for this <code>docker exec -t intelowl_postgres_12  pg_dump -U &lt;POSTGRES_USER&gt; -d &lt;POSTGRES_DB&gt; --no-owner &gt; /tmp/dump_intelowl.sql</code></li> <li>Stop che container <code>docker container stop intelowl_postgres_12</code></li> <li>Remove the backup container <code>docker container rm intelowl_postgres_12</code></li> <li>Remove the postgres volume <code>docker volume rm intel_owl_postgres_data</code> &lt;------------- remove old data, this is not exactly necessary because the new postgres has a different volume name</li> <li>Start the intermediary postgres 16 container <code>docker run -d --name intelowl_postgres_16 -v intelowl_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ --env-file env_file_postgres  library/postgres:16-alpine</code></li> <li>Add the data to the volume <code>cat /tmp/dump_intelowl.sql | docker exec -i intelowl_postgres_16 psql -U &lt;POSTGRES_USER&gt; -d &lt;POSTGRES_DB&gt;</code></li> <li>Stop the intermediary container <code>docker container stop intelowl_postgres_16</code></li> <li>Remove the intermediary container <code>docker container rm intelowl_postgres_16</code></li> <li>Update IntelOwl to the latest version</li> <li>Bring up the application back again (you can use the start script or manually concatenate your docker compose configuration)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"IntelOwl/installation/#updating-to-500-from-a-4xx-version","title":"Updating to &gt;=5.0.0 from a 4.x.x version","text":"<p>IntelOwl v5 introduced some major changes regarding how the plugins and their related configuration are managed in the application.

If not, please feel free to open an issue on Github  <p>Note</p> After having upgraded IntelOwl, in case the application does not start and you get an error like this:  <pre><code>PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/log/intel_owl/django/authentication.log\n</code></pre>  just run this: <pre><code>sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/docker/volumes/intel_owl_generic_logs/_data/django\n</code></pre>  and restart IntelOwl.

Before upgrading, some important things should be checked by the administrator: * Docker Compose V1 support has been dropped project-wide. If you are still using a Compose version prior to v2.3.4, please upgrade to a newer version or install Docker Compose V2. * IntelOwl is now started with the new Bash <code>start</code> script that has the same options as the old Python <code>start.py</code> script but is more manageable and has decreased the overall project dependencies. The <code>start.py</code> script has now been removed. Please use the new <code>start</code> script instead. * The default message broker is now Redis. We have replaced Rabbit-MQ for Redis to allow support for Websockets in the application:   * This change is transparent if you use our <code>start</code> script to run IntelOwl. That would spawn a Redis instance instead of a Rabbit-MQ one locally.   * If you were using an external broker like AWS SQS or a managed Rabbit-MQ, they are still supported but we suggest to move to a Redis supported service to simplify the architecture (because Redis is now mandatory for Websockets) * Support for multiple jobs with multiple playbooks has been removed. Every Observable or File in the request will be processed by a single playbook.  * We upgraded the base PostgreSQL image from version 12 to version 16. You have 2 choice:   * remove your actual database and start from scratch with a new one   * maintain your database and do not update Postgres. This could break the application at anytime because we do not support it anymore.   * if you want to keep your old DB, follow the migration procedure you can find below</p> <p>Warning</p> CARE! We are providing this database migration procedure to help the users to migrate to a new PostgreSQL version.   Upgrading PostgreSQL is outside the scope of the IntelOwl project so we do not guarantee that everything will work as intended.   In case of doubt, please check the official PostgreSQL documentation.  Upgrade at your own risk.  <p>The database migration procedure is as follows: - You have IntelOwl version 5.x.x up and running - Bring down the application (you can use the start script or manually concatenate your docker compose configuration ) - Go inside the docker folder <code>cd docker</code> - Bring only the postgres 12 container up <code>docker run -d --name intelowl_postgres_12 -v intel_owl_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ --env-file env_file_postgres  library/postgres:12-alpine</code> - Dump the entire database. You need the user and the database that you configured during startup for this <code>docker exec -t intelowl_postgres_12  pg_dump -U &lt;POSTGRES_USER&gt; -d &lt;POSTGRES_DB&gt; --no-owner &gt; /tmp/dump_intelowl.sql</code> - Stop che container <code>docker container stop intelowl_postgres_12</code> - Remove the backup container <code>docker container rm intelowl_postgres_12</code> - Remove the postgres volume <code>docker volume rm intel_owl_postgres_data</code> &lt;------------- remove old data, this is not exactly necessary because the new postgres has a different volume name - Start the intermediary postgres 16 container <code>docker run -d --name intelowl_postgres_16 -v intelowl_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ --env-file env_file_postgres  library/postgres:16-alpine</code> - Add the data to the volume <code>cat /tmp/dump_intelowl.sql | docker exec -i intelowl_postgres_16 psql -U &lt;POSTGRES_USER&gt; -d &lt;POSTGRES_DB&gt;</code> - Stop the intermediary container <code>docker container stop intelowl_postgres_16</code> - Remove the intermediary container <code>docker container rm intelowl_postgres_16</code> - Update IntelOwl to the latest version - Bring up the application back again (you can use the start script or manually concatenate your docker compose configuration)</p>"},{"location":"Submodules/IntelOwl/docs/source/Installation/#updating-to-500-from-a-4xx-version","title":"Updating to &gt;=5.0.0 from a 4.x.x version","text":"<p>IntelOwl v5 introduced some major changes regarding how the plugins and their related configuration are managed in the application. Before upgrading, some important things should be checked by the administrator: * A lot of database migrations will need to be applied. Just be patient few minutes once you install the new major release. If you get 500 status code errors in the GUI, just wait few minutes and then refresh the page. * We moved away from the old big <code>analyzer_config.json</code> which was storing all the base configuration of the Analyzers to a database model (we did the same for all the other plugins types too). This allows us to manage plugins creation/modification/deletion in a more reliable manner and via the Django Admin Interface. If you have created custom plugins and changed those <code>&lt;plugins&gt;_config.json</code> file manually, you would need to re-create those custom plugins again from the Django Admin Interface. To do that please follow the related new documentation * We have REMOVED all the analyzers that we deprecated during the v4 releases cycle. Please substitute them with their respective new names, in case they have a replacement.   * REMOVED <code>Pulsedive_Active_IOC</code> analyzer. Please substitute it with the new <code>Pulsedive</code> analyzer.   * REMOVED <code>Fortiguard</code> analyzer because endpoint does not work anymore. No substitute.   * REMOVED <code>Rendertron</code> analyzer not working as intended. No substitute.   * REMOVED <code>ThreatMiner</code>, <code>SecurityTrails</code> and <code>Robtex</code> various analyzers and substituted with new versions.   * REMOVED <code>Doc_Info_Experimental</code>. Its functionality (XLM Macro parsing) is moved to <code>Doc_Info</code>   * REMOVED <code>Strings_Info_Classic</code>. Please use <code>Strings_Info</code>   * REMOVED <code>Strings_Info_ML</code>. Please use <code>Strings_Info</code> and set the parameter <code>rank_strings</code> to <code>True</code>   * REMOVED all <code>Yara_Scan_&lt;repo&gt;</code> analyzers. They all went merged in the single <code>Yara</code> analyzer   * REMOVED <code>Darksearch_Query</code> analyzer because the service does not exist anymore. No substitute.   * REMOVED <code>UnpacMe_EXE_Unpacker</code>. Please use <code>UnpacMe</code>   * REMOVED <code>BoxJS_Scan_JavaScript</code>.
